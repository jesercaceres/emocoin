        <p>
          At its core, EmoCoin is the unapologetic memecoin born out of
          heartache and glitter. It is an open-source peer-to-peer
          cryptocurrency that uses blockchain technology to tokenize sadness,
          poetry, and eyeliner.
        </p>
        <p>
          EmoCoin represents a decentralized way to store emotional value
          on-chain, validated by a decentralized network of people who have
          cried to early 2000s playlists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond technology, EmoCoin is a movementâ€”summarized in the

          , and supported by an unapologetically emotional community just like
          you.
